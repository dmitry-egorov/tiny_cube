---------TODO---------
- introduce point types
- implement switching...

+ refactor to exclusive points


-------THOUGHTS-------
segment contains points
points are exclusive to a segment
points contain information about connected segments
point can be restrictive or free

transition can be made only when a path is below or at the height of the subject


free, restricted

free: fall when point at the side opposite to the movement is out of the path
restrictive: stop and set to point when outside the point

restricted to free: switch only when at or above the path with the central point

free to restricted: falling down, switch when falling

free to free
