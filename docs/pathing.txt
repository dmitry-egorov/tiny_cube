---------TODO---------
- stop at follower's width
- introduce point types
- implement switching...

+ refactor to exclusive points


        _______

        _______
_______-

if (higher)
{
	stop
}
if (lower)
{
	switch and go
}

watch the path only in the direction of movement

switch and stop are separate mechanics

switch to the highest level below the subject

stop watches a point further
switch watches a point below???

stop when walking to a path without connection
stop when walking to a path with connection which is higher (not airborne)

there's a problem when landing on a side




-------THOUGHTS-------
segment contains points
points are exclusive to a segment
points contain information about connected segments
point can be restrictive or free

transition can be made only when a path is below or at the height of the subject


free, restricted

free: fall when point at the side opposite to the movement is out of the path
restrictive: stop and set to point when outside the point

restricted to free: switch only when at or above the path with the central point

free to restricted: falling down, switch when falling

free to free
